              <p>
                  I am a<strong> certified gender, relationship and sex counsellor.</strong> Combining a sociological and psychological approach   I attempt to create a safe space for my clients to introspect and improve the quality of their relationships to themselves and by extension to others.  I trust that I can welcome my clients in a compassionate and empathetic space in order for them to develop and strengthen their self-compassion and acceptance to eventually live freer and happier.

              <p>
                  I have a  Msc in Gender and Sexuality from the University of Amsterdam as well as a training in psycho-sexological counselling from France.
                  Having lived in many places and being a mix of many different cultures I have a deep understanding of people from all types of backgrounds. I offer counseling in English, French and Italian.

              <p>
                  My approach is based on intersectional feminism, queer and critical race theory which means that I deconstruct the issues that my clients face in a way that understands how structural and systemic issues infiltrate peopleâ€™s intimate lives.
